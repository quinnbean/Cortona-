# Cortona Project Rules

## Git Workflow (MANDATORY)

- **NEVER push directly to the `main` branch**
- Always create a new feature branch for any changes
- Use descriptive branch names:
  - `feature/description` for new features
  - `fix/description` for bug fixes
  - `add/description` for additions
  - `update/description` for updates
- Commit with clear, descriptive messages
- Push the branch and create a Pull Request
- Wait for user approval before merging
- After PR is merged, delete the feature branch

## Example Workflow

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
# ... make changes ...
git add -A
git commit -m "Add my new feature"
git push origin feature/my-new-feature
gh pr create --title "Add my new feature" --body "Description of changes"
```

## Code Style

- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Use clear, descriptive variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Test changes before committing

## Deployment

- This project deploys to Render (https://cortona.onrender.com)
- Render auto-deploys when changes are pushed to `main`
- Always test locally before creating a PR

## Project Structure

- `app.py` - Main Flask application with embedded HTML/CSS/JS
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `nixpacks.toml` - Render build configuration
- `Procfile` - Process configuration
